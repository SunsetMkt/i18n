## Volunteer

We're managing translations with [Crowdin | wuwatracker-i18n](https://crowdin.com/project/wuwatracker-i18n) so that anyone can easily edit & make comments on translations! Your contributions will reflect on the site once a proofreader accepts your suggestion.

### Proofreader Applications

In order for translations to get staged for a merge to our production codebase, a [proofreader](https://support.crowdin.com/enterprise/for-translators/#proofreading) is required to approve the translations that were suggested.

If you're interested in proofreading for your language, you can apply for a staff position at our [Discord Server](https://wuwatracker.com/discord).

### Disclaimer

WuWa Tracker is currently in active development, which means certain keys may change or even be removed over time. While we understand this may be inconvenient for translators, we make every effort to avoid unnecessary disruptions and ensure no work is lost. Major changes, such as during significant rewrites, may occasionally require such adjustments.

Rest assured, Crowdin’s Translation Memory automatically saves previous translations, allowing suggestions for future similar keys and minimizing redundancy.

By contributing, you acknowledge and accept that your translations may be modified or removed as necessary for development or moderation purposes, such as addressing inappropriate contributions.

We greatly appreciate your understanding and support!
